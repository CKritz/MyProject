<h2> Welcome to the Binge! </h2>
<p> In the high-paced world we live in, who has time to schedule TV
    viewing?  The trend shows that 70% of Americans binge watch their
    favorite shows.  Part of this trend is based on our scheduling
    practices, but it can also be attributed to show popularity. </p>

<p> In the past, we may have heard about a show that gained popularity
    during the third season, for example.  Before the popularity of
    websites providing viewing of past episodes, viewers were at the
    mercy of paying for seasons on video or hoping for the availability
    at the local video stores or libraries.  In this high technology
    age, accessibility to a large variety and TV shows and entertainment
    genres has made this an inconvenience no longer.  </p>

<p> Please visit the Highlighted Genres to see a list of shows under
    our favorite categories and options where the series can be viewed.

<h3> HAPPY WATCHING!!!!!! </h3>
